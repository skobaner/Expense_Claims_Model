    "# Decision Tree Visualization for Expense Claim Validation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds hierarchical decision trees based on the Ontario; Travel, Meal, and Hospitality Expenses Directive (2020). The decision trees are designed to simplify the complex policy conditions into understandable logic flows for validating expense claims. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision trees are constructed for the following categories:\n",
    "- Meal Claims: Includes conditions such as government business relevance, distance from the office, prior approval, alcohol restrictions, and group meal rules.\n",
    "- Travel Claims: Includes conditions such as government business purpose, pre-approval, type of travel (Air/Rail, Vehicle, Accommodation), documentation requirements, and submission deadlines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the decision trees are combined under a shared root decision point to distinguish between Meal and Travel claims. The final graph provides a unified entry point for validation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, Contractors and Consultants are not included in the Decision Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The visualizations are rendered as scalable vector graphics (SVG) for high-resolution display and export.\n"
